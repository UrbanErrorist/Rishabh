<!-- The Writing of the blog starts here.     -->


<p>Contempt of Court: The Turn-Of-The-Century Lynching That Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism was written by Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips Jr. about an incident that occurred in Chattanooga, Tennessee very shortly after the reconstruction period. During the first half of the twentieth century, Jim Crow laws were in effect and lynchings were a common neighborhood event. Even though they do not go into the social aspects of why this crime was committed, Curriden and Phillips Jr. successfully argue that Ed Johnson was licked before he was ever accused of a crime because the white community wanted to assert their dominance as the superior race by killing a black man, no matter who it was or if they were even guilty of the crime. </p>
<p>In December of 1905, a black man was suspected of terrorizing the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Many crimes had occurred, but the worst of the crimes was the rape of a white woman named Nevada Taylor. Ed Johnson, an uneducated black man who worked at Last Chance Saloon, was arrested, charged, and convicted by an all-white jury for the rape of Nevada Taylor even though Nevada Taylor had stated that she never got a good look of the man who raped her because he had forced her unconscious. After multiple violent mobs and a stay of execution by the United States Supreme Court, Ed Johnson was lynched by an angry mob. The only reason Ed Johnson was able to be lynched was because the sheriff, Sheriff Shipp, ordered that there be only one officer watching the entire jail even though there was a high risk of an angry mob breaking out again. </p>
<p>Ed Johnson was damned before the police ever even had a suspect. The local newspapers would put out articles on “negro thugs” (Curriden & Phillips, 1999, p. 30). The newspapers almost exclusively painted African Americans in a terrible light and dehumanizing them in any way possible. For example, the article that came out the day after Nevada Taylor had been raped read “The fiendish and unspeakable crime committed in St. Elmo last night by a Negro brute, the victim being a modest, pretty, industrious and popular girl, is a sample of the crimes which heat southern blood to the boiling point and prompt law abiding men to take the law into their own hands and mete out swift and horrible punishment” (Curriden & Phillips, 1999, p. 33). The paper paints Nevada as this angel and paints the black perp as a “brute,” then justifies the vigilantes who take the law into their own hands. The authors of this book do a great job at giving quotes from local newspapers reporting on the case that helps the reader get a sense of the town's mentality. </p>
<p>The day Ed Johnson was arrested on suspicion that he had raped Nevada Taylor, an angry mob grew outside of the jail he was being held in wanting to get vigilante justice. Members of the outraged mob cut the phone lines to the jail, shattered every window in the jail, and attempted to break down the door of the building to lynch Ed Johnson. The only reason that no one died that night was because the judge who was to hear the case, Judge McReynolds. Judge McReynolds had a great respect for the criminal justice system, and told the mob that he will make sure justice is served. However, he also expedited the trial, giving the defense very little time to prepare. During the trial, the gallery, which only consisted of people who were white and in favor of the state, would cheer when the prosecutors made a point and snarl at objections by the defense without so much as a word from the judge (Curriden & Phillips, 1999, p. 96). The jury would at times be balling and showing emotions that could influence other jurors, sometimes going as far as threatening to kill Ed Johnson if they had the chance to. 
<p>The defense called numerous people to the stand that verified Johnson’s alibi. Isaac Dorset was the most solid eyewitness testimony that put Johnson at Last Chance Saloon at the time of the rape (Curriden & Phillips, 1999, p. 101). The seven other witnesses also claim to have seen Johnson at/or around the time of which the rape had taken place. The prosecution at one point had brought in an inspector for the railway that Johnson supposedly took to rape Nevada Taylor. However, that utterly backfired when the defense brought up that Johnson would have had to been away from the Last Chance Saloon for an hour or more. A surprise witness emerged during the trial that supposedly saw the perpetrator, but could not positively identify Ed Johnson as the man who raped Nevada. Nevada Taylor also refused to positively identify Ed Johnson as the man who raped her. </p>
<p>Despite all of these facts placing him in the bar and not at the scene of the crime, Ed Johnson was still found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Noah Parden, a well known African American lawyer, and Lewis Shepherd, a white former judge and attorney, took on Johnson’s case in federal court by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Upon review, the federal judge they had appealed the case to did not feel he had the legal authority to overrule the verdict. However, he did grant Johnson a stay of execution for ten days to give Parden and Sheppard to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. After pleading his case to the Supreme Court,  Justice Harlan decided to grant Ed Johnson a stay of execution. This was one of the first times that a black lawyer had represented his client in the Supreme Court. Not only that, but the Court actually agreed with him. </p>
<p>The events that transpired following the news of Ed Johnson’s stay of execution were stomach churning. Sheriff Shipp dismissed all but one guard from the prison that night, even after being warned of another potential angry mob. The jail was broken into that night by a large mob. The mob grew bigger and bigger by the minute outside of the jail, many of them angry and quoting the Ku Klux Klan. Upon breaking into the jail, they found Ed Johnson. They put a rope around his neck, dragging him to the country bridge. There, Ed Johnson was hanged. When he did not die quick enough, members of the mob began shooting him. As a last attempt to desecrate Ed Johnson’s lifeless body, the mob pinned a note to Johnson, stating: “To Justice Harlan. Come get your nigger now.” (Curriden & Phillips, 1999, p. 204). </p>
<p>Contempt of Court does a fantastic job at explaining the significance of United States v. Shipp. Shipp did not expect to be indicted. In fact, he thought the Supreme Court was going to clear him of any wrongdoing. Much to his dismay, Sheriff Shipp, along with several of his deputies and angry mob members, were tried and convicted of contempt of court.  This has been the only time in the history of the United States that the Supreme Court carried out a criminal trial. The Court purposefully did this trial to set forth a presidence that the fourteenth amendment is to be applied to all people, no matter their color. If the anyone goes against the fourteenth amendment and deprives someone of their life, liberty, or property, then they will suffer the legal ramifications. This book does a very good job at going in depth into this case, going so far as providing quotes from local newspapers and excerpts from the trial that back of the main claim of this book, that being that the city of Chattanooga really did not care that Johnson was an innocent man. They just wanted to intimidate black folks and insert their dominance among African Americans who were slowly but surely gaining equal rights at this time. Contempt of Court makes an extremely complex case easy to follow without sacrificing any of the detail because of the authors’ focus on continuity. The book could easily be followed by someone with minimal knowledge of the United States criminal justice system. However, the book does not go too deep into why cases like Ed Johnson’s happened. There are social theories that might help explain why this community decided to act the way it did. I believe it could also be argued that the books authors believe that this case should be as well known as the Brown v. Education or Plessy v. Ferguson cases because of its historical ruling and context. While the Ed Johnson case is tragic, the ruling that came out of United States v. Shipp changed how courts looked at equal rights and began to lay the foundation for cases like Brown v. Education and the Civil Rights Act of 1954 and the follow up Civil Rights Act of 1964 that progress equality.</p>
