    <p>Atheism, the disbelief of all deities, seems to me to be the most logical explanation of an external world that humans do not yet fully understand.  Thus it is my ‘faith’; however, atheism should not indeed be called faith.  It is a system of belief; in fact, it is a non-belief of any higher power, and in this sense, it is similar to religion, albeit unlike religion, no faith is placed into the existence of a deity.  There are various ways to rationalize logically and arrive at this conclusion. Take, for example, the issue of religion and its validity. It is clear that any single religion has a very low chance of being the “correct” religion.  Because there can only be at most one religion, which is completely true if any at all. There is the argument that every religion, though with different practices, equates to the same principles and fundamental beliefs. This is proven to be a futile argument because if one religion contradicts another, the entire theory is disproved. Therefore, we are back to where we began.  Imagine for example, that there exist five hundred religions in the world, that would mean that on average each religion would have a 1/500 chance of being the true religion. Also imagine that each of these religions has a unique deity (This is not always the case, Christianity, Judaism, and Muslim faiths each share the same God, for example) As it turns out, there are in fact many more than this, in history and in the present.  However for the point of illustrating this example we will arbitrarily decide five hundred. Because each deity in this example is unique, logically only one of these five hundred can be the “real” deity.  This is of course making the assumption that a deity does indeed exist, which is not necessarily the case.</p>

    <p>Making this quite large assumption, that one religion is correct, this would mean that the other four hundred ninety-nine religions would all be false.  Conversely, the other situation where there is no deity; in this situation, all five hundred religions would be false.  Thus we are left with only two scenarios, one in which four hundred ninety-nine religions are false, or all five hundred.  This is very one sided, either all are false, or all but one is, in other words, this would not be a bell curve, as the only possibilities exist on the very outskirts.  Of course, as has been stated, the case where one is valid exists under the assumption that there is in fact a deity. This is a large assumption, and in my mind makes this case less valid.  If one were valid, would there not be some quality about it that made it stand out as true, the answer is no, in this world, no one religion is more valid than another.  For these two reasons, I find it easy to make the jump, and to  reason that it seems likely that in lieu of four hundred ninety-nine religions being false, five hundred are.</p>
    <p>Along this same line of thought, questioning the legitimacy of religions, we can make the claim that indeed all religions are invalid with a simple example, which also shows science to be valid.  Imagine that all information humans possessed was suddenly erased.  No biological changes occur, just the knowledge we have built up as a species no longer exists.  This can be thought of as starting from scratch, in this scenario humans would have to rediscover and relearn everything. So we can ask the question, what would humans relearn, in this scenario? Given time, humans would eventually rediscover agriculture, how to farm land effectively.  Eventually humans would rediscover chemistry, and all the exact same elements we know today.  Indeed all science, everything we know about the natural world, physics, mathematics, and biology, would all be restored. Clearly all of this would be true, with differing conventions used, but the same information pragmatically.</p>
    <p>However now I pose the question,: “Is there even the slightest chance that in this new world, there would exist the same religions as in ours?” The logical response to this question in my mind is no.  The probability of two religions being created which were exactly the same in both of these worlds seems so obscurely small, so infinitesimally small to be significant.  In fact, in this world it is possible that nobody would even come up with the notion of a deity.  From this example we arrive at the conclusion that all religions are human creations, simply the inventions of one or multiple human minds.  When we examine the real world, we come to the same realization, there is no evidence, much less proof, of any of these religions being valid.  There are only claims made by individuals, which are not valid, nor verifiable, in the sense science is.</p>
    <p>These defenses of atheism all revolve around discrediting the validity of religions, but there are other approaches as well.  We can look at the conflict between theists and atheists.  Many theists put the burden of proof on atheists, to prove that no greater being exists.  I would argue that this is fundamentally flawed.  Atheism is a non-belief, so logically the burden of proof be on anyone who does indeed believe in a higher power.  However belief in a deity cannot be proven, and in fact, nor can it be disproven, illustrated by the following example.</p>
    <p>Imagine that you were told, quite arbitrarily, that there is some sort of virus that is actually more intelligent than, humans, capable of taking over the world at a moments notice.  This virus has complete lingual capabilities and a full understanding of mathematics, as well as many other impressive feats.  However this virus, for its own convenience, decides to not make it presence known to humans, and rather prefers to live in symbiosis with them and other mammals, taking advantage of their free resources.  You are also told that it has the ability to go undetected when somebody is trying to observe it or feel it.  All this information is put forth to you, do you believe it?</p>
    <p>My answer and I assume the most common answer to this question is no.  However can anybody prove this to be false?  No.  Just as nobody can prove it to be true.  This is a theory which is unfalsifiable.  This is analogous to any religion currently in existence.  The reason people are free to choose their own religions is for this very reason, each one can be neither proven or disproven.  In this sense the choice is subjective, people are free to choose what they prefer.</p>
    <p>This was not always the case with religions, however.  Many religionsus precepts have been disproven with advances in science.  For example, the Vikings of Scandinavia believed that occasionally a wolf god of the named Skoll would bite off pieces of or sometimes the entire sun.  They believed their prayers drove him away and made him return the sun as well.  Of course, with our advances in science, we now know this phenomenon to be an eclipse.  Indeed many past religions used deities and supernatural beings to explain natural phenomena which they did not understand at the time.  Current religions remain unfalsifiable simply because they attempt to explain something which cannot be proven by science.  Many, if not all current religions rely on the fact that science has not led to the discovery of the origins of our universe, and are still viable because if this.  If this discovery is made, if the creation of the universe is verifiably proved, all these religions which offer alternative explanations, will be rendered invalid, just as religions have before them.</p>
    <p>These are just a few of the defenses of atheism which exist, many more have been proposed by philosophers.  The primary idea is that atheism is the status-quo, because it is the non-belief of any higher power, and only in the natural world.  The burden of proof then rests with anybody claiming there indeed exists a higher power.  Instead of doing this, religions rely upon their ability of being unfalsifiable, the ability to not be disproven, rather than to be proven.  However with advances in science, these religions may too be eventually disproven, thereby ultimately proving atheism.</p>
