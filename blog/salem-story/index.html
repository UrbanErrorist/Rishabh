<p>In, Salem Story: Reading of the Witch Trials of 1692 , Bernard Rosenthal openly criticized and publicly evaluated the surviving documentation regarding the 1692 Witch Trials of Salem, Massachusetts. Challenging the idea that these events were initiated and perpetuated by a circle of attention seeking hysterical girls, Rosenthal delves into trial transcripts, indictments, public records, and other writings, to better understand the events. In this detective-like, closed-reading narrative, Rosenthal pieces together a new story of social behaviorism and survival, while exploring contemporary stigmas related to Witches and Witchcraft due to these events. It becomes very clear that our present day mythology of the Salem Witch Trials are a gross oversimplification. The historical value of the colonial religious context was vastly undermined; while unequal and unauthorized distribution of power in an isolated community prevailed. Presently, there is no greater display throughout history of the harsh results attributed to fear mongering and bandwagoning than the Salem Witch Trials.</p>
<p>Rosenthal, an American acclaimed scholar, historian, and professor from Binghamton University, New York, was inspired to research and understand the events of 1692 after a visit to a gift shop in historic Salem, MA. A coffee mug decorated with “the witch of our Halloween images” (4) caught his attention and begged the question: Why were the twenty victims of the Salem Witch Trials personified in a derogatory manner; rather than the Christian martyrs they had been portrayed as? A seemingly innocent question which, Rosenthal admits, led him into a daunting yet fascinating research project, but also the realization that, “...what I had been taught about Salem [was] not supported by the evidence I had found” (5). This realization is the basis and motivation for writing Salem Story: Reading of the Witch Trials of 1692.</p>
<p>The majority of the surviving documents from the Salem Witch Trials can be found in The Salem Witchcraft Papers, a compilation of verbatim transcripts of court records, edited by Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum. Although this three volume collection serves as the basis for the research Rosenthal conducted; other writings, such as letters and/or diaries from those involved with the trials are easily attainable, the combination of these historical works illustrate details rarely discussed, and insight into the mind of a colonial in the midst of a witchcraft conspiracy. The Salem Witchcraft Papers are by no means a narrative, but rather a collection of the trial documents of each person involved, in alphabetical order. The mere organization of these historical accounts lends to reason that Salem Story was intentionally organized in a chronological manner, bringing the story to life in the reader’s mind. Sifting through these official documents was, as explained in Salem Story, a tremendously tedious task.</p>
<p>Witch Hunt - Where a person decides to target another person for reasons which may, or may not, be obvious. It may be a work colleague who decides to undermine and belittle a co-worker, or it could be a person who makes it their objective to slander the reputation of a 'friend' or associate. Essentially, it is a targeted attack against one person, for reasons that are not necessarily tangible. Trying to find someone to target and humiliate. </p>
<p>Salem Story begins with the dissection of common stories and mythologies surrounding the events of 1692. The traditional story often found in our history books tells the tale of a circle of girls that became enthralled in stories of witchcraft. These unfamiliar stories incited mischief among the girls as a family slave named Tituba presented the idea of witchcraft. Following the slave girl's vivid recount, the young girls began to act wildly, asserting that they had become bewitched. The town of Salem was shocked by the behavior and begin blindly arresting and indicting anyone with whom the girls named. During the trials, the girls acted out by throwing themselves on the floor of the courtroom in convulsion. The display of such provocative nature was unheard of during these times, and ultimately providing the judges and jury enough evidence to declare the accused guilty. A total of twenty people were publically executed. It is important to note that many documents have been damaged or lost over time leaving room for some uncertainty and inconsistencies with popular stories. Rosenthal also speculates there is also a strong possibility that documents have been deliberately edited, fabricated, destroyed, or simply never existed as a result of poor record keeping in colonial times.</p>
<p>The popular story of Salem comes from Salem Witchcraft published in 1867 by Charles Upham, and has continued to circulate through the history books ever since. Rosenthal goes on to explain how authors have a way of transforming stories to resonate with the current time so readers can better connect with the writing. It is possible that this tragic episode in our history was a result of mass hysteria, but Rosenthal theorizes that most of the accusations and events (such as Elizabeth Hubbard bound to a tree, missing items found in the woods, or the assault of Sarah Good and her apparition) were collusion or pranks. He also speculates most of the accusations are without a doubt fabricated, referencing contradictory or even senseless stories told by the accusers. Historians juggle with several explanations for these events, the most popular suggests the fraudulent claims of witchcraft were initially a response to a sexualized and suppressed society, adhering to the psychological theories of Sigmund Freud. Another popular theory, offered by Linnda Caporael, points to ergotism (hallucinations caused by a poisoning upon ingesting a fungus which often infects rye) as the cause of the “hysterical” behavior. America: A Narrative History also lists several popular theories: some of the accused women owned property, some had previous quarrels with other villagers, the Native American presence terrified villagers and caused panic or “It may have represented nothing more than theatrical adolescents trying to enliven the dreary routine of everyday life.” (138). Rosenthal suggests the early accusations were possibly a result of child abuse, referencing Ann Putnam, who, on June 3, 1692, testified against the accused witch, John Willard, who whipped her infant sister to death years prior.</p>
<p>Salem Story evaluates the history and trial transcripts for each person involved, concluding some of the accused witches were involved in previous quarrels with other villagers, while other characters have been combined or even confused for different villagers over the years. Other misconceptions are also addressed: both men and women of all ages claimed to be afflicted, not just teenage girls, and that those who were found guilty and hanged were the only accused who would not confess. This is demonstrated in the case of Margaret Jacobs, an accused witch who maintains innocents throughout her trial, but is found guilty and thrown into jail, facing a public hanging. The theme of corruption in an effort to justify actions in the judiciary system is also present when the accused Mary Warren claims that her accuser, Elizabeth Hubbard, is also a witch. Rosenthal writes “For the first time, an accuser had defected and claimed fraud: here was an invitation to examine honestly the credibility of the accusers. The authorities chose not to do so – not then, not later.” (46)</p>
<p>As the trials continued, an unusual pattern became clear: “confess and avoid the gallows” (42). Rosenthal has concluded this formula explains the dramatic number of convicted witches, also adding “As the pattern emerged, people who had not even been accused joined the ranks of the accusers, the one sure place of security” (42), explaining the alarming number of accusers.</p>
<p>This does not in general represent hysteria, although people were surely agitated and frightened; rather it represents a desperate logic, rational and correct, that the safest way out of the web of accusations was through confession, accusation, or claims of affliction. (Rosenthal 50)</p>
<p>The behavior that was exhibited by Salem villagers further demonstrated the use of fear and manipulation in communal governing tactics. The “afflicted victims” of witchcraft were direct products of their environment. Namely, fear from the instability shown by community members that hurled accusations rather than justice. Confessions entirely comprised of fallacies were manipulatively obtained by the threat of being publicly hanged.</p>
<p>After the hanging of the first five convicted witches, more creative patterns became popular among the accused. As the trials proceeded through the summer months, those who were accused: “confess[ed] to save their lives” (Rosenthal 104). Accused witchcraft practitioners claimed that one or more of the prior executed witches had possessed them. These acts aimed to intentionally misguide the investigation, mitigating the involvement of other innocent townspeople. In the early months of the trials, “Each confession validated a previous act of the court” (Rosenthal 152). By September, the power of the courts had begun to “crumble under the weight of its success” (152) in exposing the witchcraft conspiracy, due to the alarming number of confessed witches. Suspicions of fallacy and trickery in Salem and surrounding towns began to surface. Anticipating its impending demise, the court accelerated the executions and hanged nine final people before credibility in the process was lost. The trials were officially ceased when governmental forces shut down the special Court of Oyer and Terminer, moving the remaining trials to a new court where the accusers lost their power to skepticism, putting an end to the episode.</p>
<p>Salem Story includes multiple excerpts from trial transcripts, letters, and diaries of the villagers involved, but these excerpts were written in Old English style making the meaning more difficult to comprehend. Despite transcript excerpts and an exceptionally detailed analysis following each excerpt, Salem Story does not offer any kind of prologue to late 17th century living, it offers no information about the population, original settlers, environment, interaction with Native American tribes, or culture. Therefore, reading will require basic knowledge of life during colonial times, and especially an understanding of Puritan values and their lifestyle centered on religion and superstition. This narrative is ideal for additional scholarly reading regarding the Salem Witch Trials, and will be an esteemed research source for future studies.</p>
<p>By the end of his research, Rosenthal had strung together a fascinating new story of Salem, correcting numerous errors in both popular and scholarly tales. Salem Story lets the reader peer into a brief moment of early American history, while exploring and applying modern psychological theories to each individual trial. Rosenthal proves there is a clear methodology behind the Salem Witch Trials for the court, the accusers, and the victims of the process. This provides the reader with a thorough analysis and more sophisticated understanding of the events that took place in 1692.</p>
